DeepSeek Harness Desktop is a macOS desktop app for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It packages the upstream Web UI and its required Node runtime inside a native app, so end users can install it normally without cloning source code or configuring Node.js.

## Install on macOS

Download the matching **DMG** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lucaslus/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases): choose **arm64** for Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs or **x64** for Intel Macs. Open it, then drag **DeepSeek Harness** into **Applications**. Because this project does not use an Apple Developer certificate, macOS may require a first-time Control-click → **Open** confirmation. Once installed, Spotlight, Finder, and the Dock can find it normally.

Use **Check for Updates…** in the app menu to open GitHub Releases, download the matching newer DMG, and replace the copy in Applications.

## Provider brand icons

Models are easier to scan when each provider carries its recognizable brand
mark. DeepSeek Harness Desktop displays bundled provider icons in Settings,
the composer model selector, and the `/model` command, so the same model route
has a consistent visual identity everywhere.

![Model settings with provider brand icons](docs/images/model-provider-brand-icons.png)

Custom providers are not limited to a generic gateway icon. In **Customized
settings**, choose a bundled brand such as Kimi / Moonshot AI, Qwen, MiniMax,
OpenAI, Anthropic, or another supported provider. The selection is stored with
the provider configuration and is shown everywhere that provider's models can
be selected. The bundled catalog works offline and never loads arbitrary remote
image URLs.

## Build a DMG yourself

On macOS with Node.js 24+:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucaslus/dsh-desktop.git
cd dsh-desktop
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
node apps/electron/scripts/package-mac.mjs
open "apps/electron/dist/release/DeepSeek Harness-0.0.3-$(node -p 'process.arch').dmg"
```

The output folder also contains a ZIP archive. All builds are unsigned; Gatekeeper warnings and the first-time Control-click → **Open** confirmation are expected.

## Release process

The release workflow builds separate unsigned Apple Silicon and Intel
installers. Update `apps/electron/app/package.json` to the release version,
then push a matching `electron-v<version>` tag. GitHub Actions creates a
**draft** GitHub Release with both DMGs and ZIPs. Review the draft and publish
it when it is ready. No GitHub Actions secrets or Apple Developer account are
required.

## Upstream

This project is a desktop-oriented fork of DeepSeek Harness. The upstream project supplies the harness, Web UI, and plugin architecture; this fork carries the native macOS shell and desktop workflow. Upstream source: [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

## Development

Read the [development guide](docs/development.md) and [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md). For agents, follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

For the Electron desktop app, run `pnpm run dev:electron` from the repository root. Client changes hot-reload; Electron, Host, and Web shell source changes restart the development window automatically.
